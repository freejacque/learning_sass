@import can be used to import other scss files

everything is imported into a main.scss file and that file is used to create the css file

file structure:
  Sass:
    helper:
      _mixins.scss
      _placeholders.scss
      _variables.scss
    main.css
    main.scss
  index.html

partial naming _filename.scss

import partial:
@import "variables";

@extend - used to give one class the rules of another, removes the need to have multiple classes on an element

placeholders: can only be used when used as an @extend
ex a%drink {
  font-size: 2em;
}

.lemonade {
  @extend %drink;
}
in css:
a.lemonade {
  font-size: 2em;
}
