@import can be used to import other scss files

everything is imported into a main.scss file and that file is used to create the css file

file structure:
  Sass:
    helper:
      _mixins.scss
      _placeholders.scss
      _variables.scss
    main.css
    main.scss
  index.html

partial naming _filename.scss

import partial:
@import "variables";

@extend - used to give one class the rules of another, removes the need to have multiple classes on an element
