Sass Functions


 fade-out:
  makes a color more transparent, takes a number between 0 and 1 and decreasing opacity by that amount

 fade-in:
  increases the opacity of a color

adjust-hue($color, $degrees):
  changes the hue of a color. Takes a color and a number of degrees (usually between -360 degrees and 360 degrees), and rotates the color wheel by that amount.


Sass math operations:

addition +
subtraction -
multiplication *
division /
modulo %.

- to multiply units use ex. 10px * 10 = 100px (CSS doesn't accept squared units)

- when / is division
  width: $variable/6; //division
  line-height: (600px)/9; //division
  margin-left: 20-10 px/ 2; //division
  font-size: 10px/8px; //not division
